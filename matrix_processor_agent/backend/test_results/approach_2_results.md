- FICO scores properly aligned
- Loan amounts follow logical progression
- Property type relationships maintained

### Improvements from Previous Version
1. More accurate program name detection
2. Correct effective date extraction
3. Improved loan amount tier detection
4. Better relationship validation between property types

## Technical Implementation Details

### OCR Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Image preprocessing with OpenCV
   - Grayscale conversion
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Table structure detection
2. Enhanced text extraction
   - Custom Tesseract configuration
   - Context-aware pattern matching
3. Validation system
   - Rule-based checks
   - Relationship validation
   - Confidence scoring

### Pattern Recognition
- Table structure detection using morphological operations
- Header row identification with multiple patterns
- Enhanced loan amount detection with various formats
- Property type section detection

### Data Validation Rules
1. LTV Rules:
   - Primary Residence LTV ≥ Second Home LTV
   - Second Home LTV ≥ Investment Property LTV
   - Purchase/Rate & Term LTV ≥ Cash-Out LTV

2. Loan Amount Rules:
   - Decreasing tiers by property type
   - Logical progression in amounts
   - Valid range checks

3. FICO Score Rules:
   - Valid range (300-850)
   - Consistent across similar transaction types
   - Minimum requirements maintained

## Areas for Further Enhancement
1. Footnote Detection
   - Implement detection of conditional requirements
   - Parse special cases and exceptions

2. Geographic Restrictions
   - Add specific state-level restriction parsing
   - Implement overlay detection

3. Property Type Requirements
   - Enhance detection of property type specific rules
   - Add support for mixed-use properties

4. Credit Requirements
   - Add mortgage history parsing
   - Implement layered risk analysis

## Next Steps
1. Implement GPT-4 Vision as secondary validation
2. Add support for multiple page matrices
3. Enhance validation rules for special cases
4. Add confidence scoring for individual cell extractions

## Technical Notes
- OCR preprocessing significantly improved accuracy
- Table structure detection helped maintain relationships
- Validation system successfully caught edge cases
- All relationships between property types and transaction types maintained correctly
